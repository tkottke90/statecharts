[x] NAME:Current Task List DESCRIPTION:Root task for conversation __NEW_AGENT__
-[ ] NAME:Node Creation & Error Handling Tests DESCRIPTION:Create tests for parseType failure scenarios and success cases. Test cases: should return error array when parseType fails, should return error array when parseType returns no node, should return success result when parseType succeeds.
-[ ] NAME:Node Without Children Tests DESCRIPTION:Create tests for nodes that don't have children. Test cases: should parse node with allowChildren=false, should parse node with allowChildren=true but no children in input, should return empty errors array for successful childless nodes.
-[ ] NAME:Node With Children - Success Cases Tests DESCRIPTION:Create tests for successful child parsing scenarios. Test cases: should parse node with children and build identifiable children map, should handle children without IDs, should return empty errors array when all children parse successfully.
-[ ] NAME:Node With Children - Error Handling Tests DESCRIPTION:Create tests for child parsing error scenarios. Test cases: should collect errors from failed child parsing and continue processing remaining children, should collect errors from children that return no root node, should skip failed children but continue processing subsequent children, should accumulate errors from multiple failed children, should handle mix of successful and failed children.
-[ ] NAME:Hierarchical ID Path Construction Tests DESCRIPTION:Create tests for nested node ID path building. Test cases: should build hierarchical paths for nested identifiable children, should handle nested children without parent ID, should collect errors from nested child parsing failures.
-[ ] NAME:Error Propagation & Collection Tests DESCRIPTION:Create tests for error handling through recursive parsing. Test cases: should propagate errors from deeply nested parsing failures, should collect both direct child errors and nested child errors, should maintain error context through recursive calls, should handle cases where child has errors but nested children succeed.
-[ ] NAME:Edge Cases Tests DESCRIPTION:Create tests for boundary conditions and unusual inputs. Test cases: should handle empty children array, should handle null/undefined children gracefully, should return appropriate error structure for various failure modes.
-[ ] NAME:Return Structure Validation Tests DESCRIPTION:Create tests to validate the parse method return structure. Test cases: should return object with root, identifiableChildren, and errors properties, should ensure errors array is always present (empty or populated), should maintain backward compatibility for success cases, should handle cases where some children succeed and others fail.
-[ ] NAME:Additional Critical Paths Tests DESCRIPTION:Create tests for remaining critical functionality. Test cases: should correctly access children using node.label property, should preserve child order in parsed result (excluding failed children), should handle mixed children (some with IDs, some without, some failed), should handle deeply nested hierarchies with errors at various levels, should continue processing after encountering parsing errors, should validate that failed children don't appear in final children array, should ensure identifiable children map only contains successfully parsed nodes.
-[ ] NAME:parseType Method Tests DESCRIPTION:Create unit tests for the parseType method focusing on input handling and node type detection. Test cases should mock all createFromJSON methods and focus on: should correctly identify 'data' node type and call DataNode.createFromJSON, should correctly identify 'datamodel' node type and call DataModelNode.createFromJSON, should correctly identify 'final' node type and call FinalNode.createFromJSON, should correctly identify 'initial' node type and call InitialNode.createFromJSON, should correctly identify 'state' node type and call StateNode.createFromJSON, should correctly identify 'transition' node type and call TransitionNode.createFromJSON, should return error for unknown node types, should handle empty input object, should handle input with multiple keys (should use first key), should pass correct input structure to createFromJSON methods, should return the exact response from createFromJSON methods without modification.
